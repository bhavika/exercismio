# exercismio


I am solving problems from [exercism.io] (http://exercism.io/languages/python) to practice Python.

Java and C# being the languages I have to use at work, I have a bit of a fluency problem with Python. 
I am attempting to solve this problem by the end of exercism.io's problem set. 


You can fork this repo to add your own implementations of the problems I have solved.
